### Usage

After install this package you will get two components: `Sticky` and `StickyElement`.

* `Sticky` component works exactly as a Scroll interactive component.
* `StickyElement` must be connected to any frame that you want to be sticky.

Example based on [30 days of Framer X](https://github.com/hermy0211/framer30-code/tree/master/Day%2007%20Sticky%20Headers) by Anne Lee.

### Handle status

`StickyElement` accepts two component instances:

* `Default`: the default element that will show when is pinned or not.
* `Pinned` (optional): a component to render when the element is fixed positioned.

In other complex scenarios, if you connect a `StickyElement` to a code component,
when its position is fixed, your code component will receive a boolean `stuck` property.

You can create a `Header` code component that works with `stuck` state like this:

```jsx
export function Header(props) {
    return (
        <Frame>
            {props.stuck ? "Pinned" : "Unpinned"}
        </Frame>
    )
}
```

This is useful, for example, if you want to perform an animation between the two states.

### Notes

* You can use code overrides to apply effects based on scroll position.
* You can set a `offset` parameter to each sticky element.
* You can set multiple `StickyElement` within scroll content frame.
* It works with `StickyElement` nested on other elements.
* It only works for vertical scroll.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important

Frames in Framer X sometimes doesn't has a top value, this happen because the element has
**Pin bottom** alignment on canvas. In that case, the component will calculate the top
position based on his height and bottom position and also from parents layout values.
It's recomendable to change `StickyElement` and parents frames alignment to **Pin top**,
it's more efficient and will work correctly.

#### ‚ö°Ô∏è Performance

The following is a 1x speed animation showing how it works efficiently with multiple cases.
